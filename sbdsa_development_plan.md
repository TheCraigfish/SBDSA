### Code Organization Principles

#### Modular Architecture
- **Feature-based modules**: Group code by feature rather than type
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
- **Dependency injection**: Use dependency injection for testability and modularity
- **Single responsibility**: Each module/class/function has a single responsibility

#### Component Design Principles
- **Reusable components**: Create a library of reusable UI components
- **Presentational vs. Container components**: Separate logic from presentation
- **Props-driven design**: Components should be driven by props rather than internal state
- **Composition over inheritance**: Favor composition patterns for code reuse

### Naming Conventions and Coding Standards

#### File Naming
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `WorkoutLogger.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatWeight.ts`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase with descriptive suffixes (e.g., `WorkoutTypes.ts`)

#### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for type safety
- **ESLint**: Airbnb style guide with customizations
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Import order**: External libraries, internal modules, relative imports
- **Naming**: Descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

#### Git Commit Convention
- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit message format
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for code style changes
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for adding tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### Branching Strategy for Version Control

#### Git Flow Model
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
│   ├── feature/user-authentication
│   ├── feature/workout-logging
│   └── feature/progress-tracking
│
├── release/v1.0.0
└── hotfix/critical-bug-fix
```

#### Branch Types
- **main**: Production-ready code, tagged with release versions
- **develop**: Integration branch for upcoming releases
- **feature/***: Feature development branches from develop
- **release/***: Release preparation branches from develop
- **hotfix/***: Critical bug fixes from main

#### Branch Protection Rules
- **main branch**: Require pull request reviews, pass CI/CD checks
- **develop branch**: Require pull request reviews, pass CI/CD checks
- **Required reviewers**: At least 2 team members for code review
- **Status checks**: All tests must pass, code coverage threshold met
