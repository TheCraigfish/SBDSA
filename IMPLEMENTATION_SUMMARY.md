# SBD SA App Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation progress of the South African Powerlifting App (SBD SA). The app is designed specifically for the South African market with a focus on powerlifting training, particularly the Squat, Bench, and Deadlift (SBD) lifts.

## Architecture

We've implemented a monorepo structure with three main packages:

1. **Shared Package** (`packages/shared`): Contains types, constants, and validation schemas shared between the mobile and backend applications.
2. **Backend Package** (`packages/backend`): NestJS-based REST API for data management and business logic.
3. **Mobile Package** (`packages/mobile`): React Native mobile application with offline-first functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

### Shared Package

- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all domain entities (User, Workout, Exercise, Set, Program, etc.)
- **Constants**: South African-specific constants including plate weights, federations, and weight classes
- **Validation Schemas**: Joi-based validation schemas for all data models
- **1RM Calculation Formulas**: Multiple algorithms for calculating one-rep max (Epley, Brzycki, etc.)

### Backend Package

- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into feature modules (auth, users, workouts, programs, analytics, competitions)
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration for app settings and database connections
- **Error Handling**: Global exception filter and response interceptor for consistent API responses
- **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL-based database design for all entities

### Mobile Package

- **Redux Store**: Comprehensive state management with slices for auth, workout, program, sync, and UI states
- **Navigation**: Complete navigation structure with tab and stack navigators for all app sections
- **Theme System**: South African-themed design system with light and dark modes
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Sync queue and status management for offline functionality
- **Common UI Components**: Loading indicator and sync status indicator components

## South African Specific Features

- **Plate Weights**: Predefined South African standard plate weights (25kg, 20kg, 15kg, 10kg, 5kg, etc.)
- **Federations**: Support for South African powerlifting federations (PSA, SAPF, CRPSA)
- **Weight Classes**: South African standard weight classes for both male and female lifters
- **Branding**: South African-themed color palette (green, orange, red)

## Technical Features

- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet connection with automatic sync when connection is restored
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end TypeScript implementation for type safety
- **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux implementation with createAsyncThunk for async operations
- **React Navigation 6**: Latest navigation library with native stack navigators
- **React Native Paper**: Material Design component library for consistent UI

## Next Steps

The foundation of the app is complete, but there are several components that need to be implemented:

1. **Database Models**: Implement WatermelonDB models for local data storage
2. **Authentication Screens**: Create login, registration, and forgot password screens
3. **Workout Logging**: Implement the core workout logging functionality
4. **Exercise Selection**: Create screens for selecting exercises during workouts
5. **Progress Tracking**: Implement charts and analytics for tracking progress
6. **1RM Calculation**: Implement the 1RM calculation functionality
7. **Plate Calculator**: Create a plate calculator for South African plates
8. **Program Features**: Implement training program selection and tracking

## Testing Strategy

The app is structured to support comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: For business logic and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: For critical user journeys
- **Device Testing**: On a range of South African Android devices

## Deployment Strategy

- **Backend**: Deploy to AWS af-south-1 region for data residency
- **Mobile App**: Android-first release to Google Play Store, followed by iOS release
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

## Compliance

- **POPIA**: The app is designed to be compliant with South African data protection regulations
- **Privacy**: User data is encrypted and stored securely
- **Permissions**: Minimal permissions requested from users

## Conclusion

The foundation of the SBD SA app is well-established with a robust architecture, comprehensive state management, and South African-specific features. The next phase of development will focus on implementing the user-facing components and core functionality.
