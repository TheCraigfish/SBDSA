## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture and feature set for a mobile powerlifting app specifically designed for the South African market. The app, tentatively named "SBD SA" (Squat, Bench, Deadlift South Africa), will focus on powerlifting's core movements while incorporating bodybuilding features for serious lifters.

Key differentiators:
- Offline-first functionality addressing South Africa's high data costs
- Integration with South African powerlifting federations
- Metric system (kg) as default
- Android-first development approach (75-80% market share)
- POPIA-compliant data handling
- Localized payment options and pricing

## South African Powerlifting Landscape Research

### Powerlifting Federations in South Africa

1. **Powerlifting South Africa (PSA)**
   - Officially recognized by World Powerlifting Congress (WPC)
   - Hosts national championships and qualifying events
   - Uses kg measurements and standard powerlifting rules

2. **South African Powerlifting Federation (SAPF)**
   - Affiliated with International Powerlifting Federation (IPF)
   - Drug-tested federation with strict anti-doping policies
   - Hosts provincial and national competitions

3. **Classic Raw Powerlifting South Africa (CRPSA)**
   - Focuses on raw lifting (no supportive equipment)
   - Growing popularity among younger lifters
   - Less strict competition requirements

### Competition Structure

- **Provincial Championships**: Qualifying events for national competitions
- **National Championships**: Annual premier events
- **Divisional Structure**: Age groups (Junior, Open, Masters) and weight classes
- **Qualifying Standards**: Minimum lifts required for national-level competition

### Market Insights

- **Gym Culture**: Strong community aspect with gym-based powerlifting clubs
- **Competition Frequency**: 4-6 major national events per year
- **Equipment Availability**: Mix of commercial and specialized powerlifting gyms
- **Coaching Landscape**: Combination of formal coaching and peer-to-peer learning
